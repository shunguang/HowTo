How to install jtop
(02/09/2024)

A. From .whl

1) download: jetson_stats-4.2.6-py3-none-any.whl
   a) find a machine which can run python3
   b) python3 -m pip wheel jetson_stats
   
2) copy jetson_stats-4.2.6-py3-none-any.whl to your target machine

3) run pip install
   pip install jetson_stats-4.2.6-py3-none-any.whl
   (if you do not have pip, you need to use pip3 to install)
   (this step will create  /usr/local/jetson_stats/jtop.service)
   
4) setup systemctl
 $cp /usr/local/jetson_stats/jtop.service /etc/systemd/system
 $systemctl daemon-reload
 $systemctl enable jtop.service
 $systemctl start jtop.service
 
 
 -------------side notes about where jtop.service should be located ----------
 > w: aha, the service file must be at /etc/systemd/system. i gave the full 
      path of jtop.service, but still has error then just gave up.   
	  the service name is also the file name, but in a fixed folder.
	  
 > Q: well it doesn't necessarily need to be in /etc/systemd/system, 
      but that's the canonical location for user-installed units
      for example most systemd units that are installed by system 
	  packages are in /usr/lib/systemd/system

 -> W: Does that mean it can only be in one of these two locations?
 -> Q: it has to be in a location that's in systemd's search path
       those two locations are part of that search path
